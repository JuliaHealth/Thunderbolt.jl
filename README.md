## Questions

If you have questions about Thunderbolt it is suggested to use the [#Thunderbolt.jl stream on Zulip](https://julialang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/413315-Thunderbolt.2Ejl).

If you encounter what you think is a bug please report it. A CONTRIBUTING.md will be provided soon with more information.

## Installation

To use Thunderbolt you first need to install Julia, see <https://julialang.org/> for details.
Installing Thunderbolt can then be done from the Pkg REPL; press `]` at the `julia>` promp to
enter `pkg>` mode:

```
pkg> add Ferrite#master, https://github.com/termi-official/Thunderbolt.jl#main
```

> [!NOTE]
> The package is under codevelopment with Ferrite.jl, which is why you will need the currently (unreleased)
> 1.0 version of Ferrite.jl and the (unregistered) Thunderbolt.jl package. Please use [these Ferrite.jl docs](https://ferrite-fem.github.io/Ferrite.jl/dev/)
> for Ferrite specific questions.

This will install Thunderbolt and all necessary dependencies. Press backspace to get back to the
`julia>` prompt. (See the [documentation for Pkg](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/), Julia's
package manager, for more help regarding package installation and project management.)

Finally, to load Thunderbolt, use

```julia
using Thunderbolt
```

You are now all set to start using Thunderbolt!

## Accessing the Documentation Offline

To build the docs you first need to install Julia, see <https://julialang.org/> for details.
Then you need to install the packages. To accomplish this you first start a julia shell in the 
docs fonder and open the Pkg REPL; i.e. press `]` at the `julia>` promp to
enter `pkg>` mode. Then you [activate and instantiate](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/#Using-someone-else's-project) via
```
(@v1.9) pkg> activate .
(docs) pkg> instantiate
```
This has to be done only once. Now you can use the provided liveserver to build and open the docs via
```
$ julia --project=. liveserver.jl
```
Now you can view the documentation at https://localhost:8000 . All further information will be provided there.
